# Geometric-Shape-Calculator-2D-3D-
This Java Swing application allows users to select from a variety of two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometric shapes, enter the required dimensions, and calculate either the area (2D shapes) or volume (3D shapes). The application also provides a visual representation of each shape within a graphical user interface.
